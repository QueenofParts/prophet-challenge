## Module 8 Challenge - Marnie Brannon
---------------------------------------------------------------
This is an exercise assigned to the class to demonstrate our understanding of the concepts up to and including in Module 8 of AI Bootcamp.

## Motivation:
My motivation in this working on this challenge is to practice and solidify several coding concepts and Python commands, syntax, usage and best practices. The exercise specifically compares groupby and pivot tables. The exercise needed to use the following subjects discussed in class:  librariies, data analisys, data visualization and data manipulation. 
I worked on this with other students in the class to help all of us share our questions, observations and ideas with one another as we learn collaboratively. 

## The focus of this exercise:
Analyzing the Marcado Libre's's financial and user data in clever ways to make the company grow. Do this by:

Step 1: Find unusual patterns in hourly Google search traffic.

Step 2: Mine the search traffic data for seasonality.

Step 3: Relate the search traffic to stock price patterns.

Step 4: Create a time series model with Prophet.   

## What did you learn?
In completing this exercise I learned the following:
    ‚Ä¢ how to access, mine and clean data 
    ‚Ä¢ merge and sort data 
    ‚Ä¢ sort, filter and compare data
 

## What did you struggle with?
I struggled for some time with getting my .env file to work correctly so i could access the API.

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.
Badges
 
Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by shields.io. You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
Features
If your project has a lot of features, list them here.
How to Contribute
If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The Contributor Covenant is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
Tests
Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.provides predictive results using inputed interest rates
